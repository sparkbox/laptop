Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a Mac for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------
We support:

* macOS Catalina (10.15)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

1. Download the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sparkbox/laptop.git
cd laptop
```

2. Review what it does
```sh
less mac
```

3. Execute the script:
```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Note: A log of the script can be found at `~/laptop.log`


Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew_tap 'caskroom/cask'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'brew-cask'

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
